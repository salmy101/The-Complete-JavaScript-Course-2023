/* Javascript has BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY in order to not break the web.

this means that old JS code from 1997 can still work no issue in 2020+ beacause 

evey year they add incremental additons to the language and never remove anything

webistes can work forever without breaking, 

BUT there is a ton of weird bugs sometimes.

The JS is not forwards compatiiblity, so how do we use modern JS today

  1. Developement pahse: use th emost lattest tools in google chrome borwser
  2. Production: we cnat control which browser a user picks, might not be modern 

  ES5 is fully supported in all borwsers = target for transpiling
  ES6/2015 - ES 2023 are modern JS and well supported but dont know if all users are using modern browsers

  future relases are ESNext need to go through 4 stages
